# **Neural Network with Levenberg-Marquardt Algorith**

## Overview

This Python code implements a neural network using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for binary classification. The neural network has two inputs and one output, making it suitable for binary classification tasks. The sigmoid function is used as the activation function, and the mean squared error is employed as the loss function.


## Requirements

### To compile and run this code, you need:

Python: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x).

Required Libraries: Install the necessary libraries using the following:


    pip install numpy matplotlib


## How to Run

    Copy the code into a Python environment.
    Ensure the required libraries are installed.
    Run the script.
